# ConfirmCalls

This app intercepts outgoing calls and cancels them. After the user has checked three buttons, the user can start the phone call again. In this way, the app prevents accidental dialing.

## Information

The app starts a service that is active all the time and listens for outgoing calls. On some devices, the outgoing call might not be intercepted fast enough, depending on the phones hardware resources. There is no guarantee that all phone calls can be blocked by the app.
